/*The need to perform an action, again and again, with little or no variations in the details each time they are executed is met by a mechanism known as a loop. This involves repeating some code in the program, either a specified number of times or until a particular condition is satisfied. Loop-controlled instructions are used to perform this repetitive operation efficiently ensuring the program doesnâ€™t look redundant at the same time due to the repetitions.

Following are the three types of loops in C++ programming.
For Loop
While Loop
Do While Loop

// Using For Loop

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int a, i;
    cout<<"How many time you wanna print the text ðŸ¥¸ = ";
    cin>>a;
    for (i=0; i<=a; i++)
    {
        cout<<"Hello!!!!ðŸ¥º"<<endl;

    }
    return 0;
